                          Apex Path Getting Started
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Ensure you have a Ground to walk on and a Unit to walk around with, as a minimum.

2. From the Component menu, add the component Apex -> QuickStarts -> Navigating Unit with Selection, to the Unit.

3. Using the Unity Layer Manager, define 3 layers for the ground, obstacles and units respectively. We call them 'Terrain', 'Blocks' and 'Units' for reference.

4a. Add all walkable ground geometry to the 'Terrain' layer.

4b. Add obstacle geometry to the 'Blocks' layer.

4c. Add units to the 'Unit' layer.

5. Locate the Layer Mapping component on the newly created Game World object in the hierarchy. Map each layer listed to the actual layer defined in Unity.

6. Press play, select the unit using the mouse and right click to make it walk.

Please refer to the actual documentation for more details on the components and services provided by Apex Path.
